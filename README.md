## Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate **Ruby and Rails developer** based in Bengaluru. I enjoy building tools like the `indian-constitution-gem` and contributing to open-source projects such as `stocks-in-the-future`. I love solving problems with code, exploring web development, and learning about new technologies.

## 🔧 Skills
- **Languages**: Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Ruby on Rails, Phoenix
- **Tools**: Git, RSpec, PostgreSQL, SQLite, WSL
- **Interests**: Open-source development, API design, data structures

## 🌟 Featured Projects
- **[indian-constitution-gem](https://github.com/nizam12khan/indian_constitution)**: A Ruby gem providing structured access to the Indian Constitution, built with clean design patterns.🔭 I plan to build a Hotwire + Turbo-powered Rails app using this gem, transforming the Indian Constitution into an interactive, searchable web application. Think of it as making one of the world's largest legal documents truly developer-friendly and accessible

    

- **[Only Verified](https://github.com/nizam12khan/only_verified)**  A Twitter-style microblogging app built while learning Rails , earlier deployed on Heroku.

- **[Depot E-commerce Sample App](https://github.com/nizam12khan/Depot)** A demo store built following *Agile Web Development with Rails*, focusing on Rails fundamentals, RESTful design, rails frontend features and shopping cart functionality.


## 🤝 Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to community projects, especially through the [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org/) initiative:

- **[stocks-in-the-future](https://github.com/nizam12khan/stocks-in-the-future)**  Official Contributor to the Stocks-in-the-Future project by Ruby for Good — contributed RSpec test cases, backend enhancements.

- **[casa](https://github.com/nizam12khan/casa)** Participated in code reviews and helped with backend improvements in a platform supporting Court Appointed Special Advocates.

## 📚 Background

- Former .NET Developer at Wipro (Client: Charles Schwab & Lloyds Bank)
- Rails Developer at Brainstorm Force – built SureCart (WordPress-based e-commerce platform)
- Contributed to the community while also exploring civil services, which has given me a unique problem-solving and communication approach

## 🔄 Career Comeback

After a focused 3-year detour preparing for the UPSC civil services exams, I’m now returning to software development with a renewed passion for Ruby on Rails. I'm actively contributing to open-source projects and sharpening my skills to grow as a backend engineer. This journey has enhanced my discipline, research mindset, and clarity — which I now apply to writing clean, maintainable code.
